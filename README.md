# advent-of-code
Public repo for my work on the Advent of Code challenges.

If you haven't heard of the Advent of Code, you should [check it
out](https://adventofcode.com)! It's basically like an advent calendar but for
programming. We're now beyond the month of December, so this will be my
repository for any work I create this year. I do intend to complete this project.
